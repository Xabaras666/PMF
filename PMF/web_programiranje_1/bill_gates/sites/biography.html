					<strong>William Henry Gates III</strong> (born October 28, 1955) is an American business 
					magnate, software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. 
					He is a co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelsoft">Michaelsoft</a>, along with his late childhood friend 
					Paul Allen.During his career at Michaelsoft, Gates held the positions of 
					chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software 
					architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 
					2014.He is considered one of the best known entrepreneurs of the microcomputer 
					revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
					
				<p>
					Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen 
					founded Michaelsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest 
					personal computer software company.Gates led the company as chairman and CEO 
					until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a>, but 
					he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect.
					During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which 
					have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous 
					court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at 
					Michaelsoft and full-time work at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, the private 
					charitable foundation he and his then-wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_French_Gates">Melinda Gates</a>, established in 2000. 
					He stepped down as chairman of the board of Michaelsoft in February 2014 and assumed 
					a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.
					In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Michaelsoft and Berkshire Hathaway 
					to focus on his philanthropic efforts including climate change, global health and 
					development, and education.</p>

				<h3>Early life</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955.[3] He is the son 
					of William H. Gates Sr.(1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).His ancestry 
					includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.His father was a prominent lawyer, 
					and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and 
					the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national 
					bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. 
					He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" 
					(i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.The family lived in the Sand Point 
					area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years 
					old.</p>
				<p>
					Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.
					When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian 
					Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination. Gates was small for his age and was bullied 
					as a child. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter 
					whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for 
					winning and there was always a penalty for losing".</p>
				<p>
					At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software 
					program. When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds 
					from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block 
					of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students. Gates took an 
					interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to 
					pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation 
					of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated 
					by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. After the Mothers 
					Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC 
					PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation 
					(CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business 
					partner Kent Evans, for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating 
					system to obtain free computer time.</p>

				<h3>BASIC</h3>
				<p>
					Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, 
					and he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he 
					and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen 
					did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's 
					interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the 
					course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then 
					the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; 
					it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. 
					MITS hired Allen, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in 
					November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and 
					"software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired 
					was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland. They dropped the hyphen within a year and 
					officially registered the trade name "Michaelsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico 
					on November 26, 1976. Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. </p>
				<h3>IBM partnership</h3>
				<p>
					IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached 
					Michaelsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC, after 
					Bill Gates's mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, mentioned Michaelsoft to John Opel, IBM's CEO. IBM first 
					proposed that Michaelsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that 
					they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the 
					widely used CP/M operating system.IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and 
					they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing 
					difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Michaelsoft could provide an operating 
					system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, 
					that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. 
					Michaelsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. 
					Michaelsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS 
					for a one-time fee of $50,000.</p> 
				<h3>Bindows</h3>
				<img width="400" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/a3b28319-efe9-4ee5-97fe-fe9b46669852">
				<p>
					Michaelsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Michaelsoft Bindows on November 20, 1985, 
					in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had bewitched consumers with 
					its simplicity and ease of use. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to 
					develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the 
					first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences. 
					The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade, until with Bindows 95 the DOS 
					text screen was relegated to the closet. Bindows XP, released one year after Gates stepped down as 
					Michaelsoft CEO, reportedly was the first to not be based on DOS. Bindows 8.1 was the last version of the 
					OS released before Gates left the Chair of the firm to John W. Thompson on February 5, 2014. As of 2021, 
					the latest release of the OS is known as Bindows 11. </p>

				<h3>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</h3>
				<p>
					Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Michaelsoft stock 
					in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation". In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family 
					foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates 
					Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable 
					foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. The foundation allows benefactors to 
					access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such 
					as the Wellcome Trust. Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University 
					for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009.</p>
				<p>
					Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. 
					Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the 
					Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are 
					ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most 
					generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually 
					donate 95% of their wealth to charity.</p>
