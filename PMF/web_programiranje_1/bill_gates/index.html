    	    		<h2>Who is Bill Gates?</h2>
    	    		<p>Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. 
    	    		He grew up in Seattle, Washington, with an amazing and supportive 
    	    		family who encouraged his interest in computers at an early age. 
    	    		He dropped out of college to start Microsoft with his childhood friend 
    	    		Paul Allen. Today, Bill co-chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 
    	    		with Melinda French Gates, where he works to give his wealth back to 
    	    		society.</p>
    	    		
    	    		<p>Bill grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. His late father, 
    	    		William H. Gates Sr., was a Seattle attorney and one of the co-chairs 
    	    		of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His late mother, Mary Gates, 
    	    		was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman 
    	    		of United Way International. Bill has three children.</p>

    	    		<h2>About MIcrosoft</h2>
    	    		<p>When Bill and Paul Allen started Microsoft, their vision of “a 
    	    		computer on every desktop and in every home” seemed farfetched to 
    	    		most people. Today, thanks to Microsoft and many other companies, 
    	    		that vision is a reality in many parts of the world, and personal 
    	    		technology is an integral part of society. </p>
    	    		<p>Bill is passionate about Microsoft’s work and will always be 
    	    		involved with the company, including his present role as a member 
    	    		of the board and technology advisor. </P>

    	    		<h2>Other Interests</h2>
    	    		<p>In addition to the foundation’s work, Bill has separately taken 
    	    		on some projects to address issues that interest him personally, 
    	    		such as delivering clean energy to everyone who needs it. </p>
    	    		<p>In all his work—with the foundation and otherwise—he’s focused 
    	    		on what he calls catalytic philanthropy: investments in innovations 
    	    		that will improve life for the poorest. They’re solutions to problems 
    	    		where markets and governments underinvest.</p>
