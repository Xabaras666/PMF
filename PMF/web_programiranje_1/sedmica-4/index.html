                    <h2>Who is Bill Gates?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. 
                        He grew up in Seattle, Washington, with an amazing and supportive family who encouraged his 
                        interest in computers at an early age. He dropped out of college to start Microsoft with his 
                        childhood friend Paul Allen. Today, Bill co-chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with 
                        Melinda French Gates, where he works to give his wealth back to society.

                    <h2>About Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>
                        When Bill and Paul Allen started Microsoft, their vision of “a computer on every desktop and in every home”
                         seemed farfetched to most people. Today, thanks to Microsoft and many other companies, 
                         that vision is a reality in many parts of the world, and personal technology is an integral part of society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bill is passionate about Microsoft’s work and will always be involved with the company, including his present 
                        role as a member of the board and technology advisor.

                    <h2>Other Interests</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the foundation’s work, Bill has separately taken on some projects to address issues that interest 
                        him personally, such as delivering clean energy to everyone who needs it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In all his work—with the foundation and otherwise—he’s focused on what he calls catalytic philanthropy: 
                        investments in innovations that will improve life for the poorest. 
                        They’re solutions to problems where markets and governments underinvest.
